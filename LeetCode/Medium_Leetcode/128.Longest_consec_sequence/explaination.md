In this problem we should find Longest consecetive sequence from the given array.

we will first save the set from the array of values.

in the given array we should check the left and right neighbours are in the set which is -1 from the number.

If found we will remove the neighbours from the set and increase the length by 1 

should find the maximum of longest value or length. Based on that Longest will be updated.

In the code if the left neighbor is not found then will check the current number is in the set, if so we will increase the length and change current number to the next number.
