Sibi Trying and logging his learning to Github. 
I am learning whatever I can and necessasary and practice all Deep learning and Machine Learning concepts.

Being a master's student I should equip this knowledge and should be ready when someone other than interviewer asks me these questions in instant.

Holding this in finger tips is all what I needed from this learning path.

I have equipped with Macbook Air M1, using VSCode as it holds to use extension GitHub Co-pilot, which I use for learning.

First I create a function of the model then I'll try using libraries.

I'll try to learn where and why to use diverse ocean of data.

Good Luck To YOU!
